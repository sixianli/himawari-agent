# Himawari Agent Project Instructions

## Documentation Governance

This repository explicitly adopts the `document-governance` skill for all governed project documentation under `docs/`.

## Documentation Language and Clarity

- Write all project documentation content in Simplified Chinese.

## Repository Boundary

- Product code and product documentation belong in this repository.
- The sibling `pi-mono` repository is an upstream source reference and debugging checkout.
- Use `/Users/triggerjames/Documents/sxl_code_work_space/pi-mono` as the canonical read-only Pi source checkout; do not rediscover other checkouts, and report if it is unavailable. This does not authorize local dependency linking or committed dependency changes.
- Do not place Himawari-specific product logic in `pi-mono`.

## Pi-First Development Principle

- Himawari is built on Pi Coding Agent and the other reusable modules in `pi-mono`. Before designing or implementing any capability related to model connections, providers, routing, streaming, model runtime, Agent Loop, tools, sessions, or extensions, inspect the current `pi-mono` source and the pinned `@earendil-works/pi-*` API first.
- Scope Pi inspection to the modules, interfaces, and callers relevant to the current change. Expand the inspection when dependencies or unresolved evidence require it.
- Reuse, compose, configure, or minimally adapt an existing Pi capability whenever it already satisfies the requirement. Do not reimplement a Pi module or protocol in Himawari merely to create a product-local version.
- Himawari-owned code should add product-specific concerns that Pi does not own, such as authority and approval, data classification and disclosure, secret handles and host secret sources, protected Payloads, durable state and audit, product-level model selection/fallback policy, budget enforcement, and Gateway/Worker/Memory integration.
- Before keeping a duplicate implementation, record the exact Pi capability that is missing, verify that a thin adapter or an upstream-compatible extension cannot satisfy the requirement, and explain why the duplicate is necessary. Prefer a Pi adapter or a small upstream extension over a second protocol implementation.
- For Pi-related design or code review, explain which Pi capability is reused, which responsibility Himawari owns, and why any additional implementation is necessary. Keep this reuse explanation proportional to the change; a small adaptation may need only a short paragraph.

## Workspace Contract

- Keep all direct external dependency versions exact; do not introduce ranges for direct dependencies.
- Import `@earendil-works/pi-*` packages only from `packages/runtime-pi`; product domain, contracts, application code and entrypoints depend on product-owned types.
- Keep published Pi dependencies in committed manifests and lockfiles. Local `../pi-mono` source linking must be opt-in, reversible and must not change committed dependency declarations.
